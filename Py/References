Student Resources: 

'Official Textbook': Bill Lubanovic: Introducing Python: Modern Computing in Simple Packages. O’Reilly Media 

For easy introductions to Python, I recommend: 

John Zelle: Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science 

Brad Miller and David Ranum: Problem Solving with Algorithms and Data Structures Using Python 

Allen B. Downey: How to think like a computer scientist: Learning with Python 

For students with a good knowledge of Python already, I recommend: 

Luciano Ramalho: Fluent Python 

David Beazley and Brian K. Jones: Python Cookbook 

Official references are richer and often invaluable: 

The Python Tutorial 

They also offer the most complete coverage of the language: 

The Python Standard Library 

Every week, there will be a widget, but to understand all aspects of their code, some resources are 

necessary. The official reference: 

Tkinter 8.5 reference: a GUI for Python
