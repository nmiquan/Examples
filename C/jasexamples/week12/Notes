 Assignment 1 Code Review
 ========================
 
 * Andrew sent me six best submissions
 
 * most were readable, some well-designed
 
 * hadn't done ADTs before Ass1
   - now consider how they could improve design
   




 
 Source Code Management
 ======================
 
 * an individual can maintain code in a directory
   - edit in-place, test changes, voila! new version
   - but what if your changes mess things up badly?
   - easier to revert to an old version ...
   
 * groups of programmers working on single code base
   - programmer X adds new feature to prog.c
   - programmer Y fixes bug in prog.c
   - need to reconcile changes to produce new version
   
   
 * revision/version/source-code control systems ...
   - maintain a single repository of code
   - storing different versions efficiently
   - allowing programmers to ...
     - check out their own copy
     - make changes to their copy
     - merge it back into the repository
 
 
 
 
     
     
 Make and Makefiles
 ==================
 * in a large code-base, keeping track of all files
   and dependencies between files is difficult
   
 * possible approaches to re-building after changes
   - recompile everything ... inefficient
   - recompile just what changed ... error-prone
   
 * Makefiles allow you to ...
   - document dependencies between files
   - describe how to rebuild after changes
 
 * make recompiles just what needs to be recompiled
   - based on dependencies and file update times
