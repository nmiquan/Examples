 Don't post code on the forum!

 And especially "My program
 doesn't work. Here it is.
 Please tell me how to fix it."

 Last week: expressions, if
 This week: while, functions
  
  
  
  
  
  
Statements
----------
  
 Assignment:
  x = 1;   y = x * x;   z = 2 + x/y;
  
 Function calls:
  scanf("%d", &n);  printf("%d\n", n);
  






Control Structures
------------------

 Sequence: 
  S1; S2; S3; ... ; Sn;

 Choice (selection):
  if (C) { S1; S2; ... } else {Sj; Sk; ...}

 Repetition (iteration):
  while (C) { S1; S2; ... }
 
 
 
 
 
 
C Programs
----------
 
 * a collection of functions
 * one function must be called main()

 Defining computations (i.e. programming)

 minimal requirements:
 * sequence  (s1 ; s2; ...)
 * choice  (if)
 * repetition  (while)

 practical requirement:
 * abstraction



 
 

 Functions
 ---------

 a C function
 * takes arguments through parameters
 * computes and returns a result
 * may have some other side-effects


 Each function has a "signature"

 factorial(n) : int -> int
 power(n,m)   : int x int -> int
 

 in C, signatures are written like

 int factorial(int);
 int power(int, int);


 in C, functions are defined like

 int factorial(int n)
 {
    int fac;
    // code to compute n!
    // store result in fac
    return fac;
 }

 * n is the name of the value passed to
   the function (parameter)
 * fac is a variable local to the function

 and invoked like

 int x;
 x = factorial(5);

 * 5 is the argument
 * factorial() code executes with n = 5
 
 
 
 // foreach n in 1..n
 i = 0;
 while (i < n) {
   do some stuff
   i = i + 1;
 }




 
 Today's examples (mainly loops)
 
 * calculating pi via 4 - 4/3 + 4/5 - 4/7 + ...
 
 * adding two numbers (function to read number)

 * maximum of a sequence of numbers
 
 * generating sequences of numbers
 
 * calculating primes
 
 * drawing a square
 
 * drawing a "flag"
